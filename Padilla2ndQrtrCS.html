				<h3> Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Rdemption and it follow outlaw Arthur Morgan and his adventures with the Van der Linde gang led by Dutch Van der Linde and Hosea Matthews. The story takes place in the American frontier
				in the year 1899 and spans 6 chapters. The game is set 15 years before the events of Red Dead Redemption 1 and even features the protagonist of that game, John Marston. In my portfolio, I will be giving a brief recap on this game because I believe it has one of the best stories
				in fiction.</h3>

				<h2> Chapter 1: Colter</h2>

				</a>
				<h3> The game begins with the gang stuck in the mountains of Amberino. They are on the run from the law after a failed heist in the town of Blackwater, where they left most of their money. This is when
				we meet our protagonist, Arthur Morgan. He is sent to find the gang a place to stay at to lay low during the harsh winter. They decide to settle on the abandoned town of Colter, where they must
				hunt and forage for supplies in order to survive. After several encounters with a long-time rival gang, the O'driscols, the gang leave the mountains and move to another camp, but not before 
				robbing a train that belongs to a oil man named Cornwall.</h3>

				</a>
				<h3> Hosea, the gang's co-leader chooses the next camp location,which just so happens to be near the town of Valentine, a small settlement that offers plenty of money
				for the gang to rob. For next few weeks, Arthur does several jobs for the gang to earn them money, one of which is loan collecting. One of these loan collections has Arthur beating a man with tuberculosis 
				nearly to death because he was unable to fulfill the debt. However, as Dutch, John, Strauss (in charge of loans), and Arthur are drinking at the saloon, Leviticus Cornwall, the man whos train they robbed, arrive with his henchmen and attempt to kill 
				the gang as revenge. This leads to a massive shootout in the town, but the group is able to escape. Once they get back to camp they are confronted by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, a group of bounty hunters led by Agent Ross. They give the gang one chance to surrender themselves peacefully but they refuse and Agent Ross is forced to leave. The gang decide that it is time to relocate as Ross could come back with more men next time.

				</a>
				<h3> Arthur, alongside Charles, who is another gang member, find a new location for the camp in the state of Lemoyne, called Clemen's Point. The camp is located near the town of Rhodes, where two rival families, the Grays and the Braithwaites, have been feuding 
				for decades. Hosea finds out about gold that the two families may posses, and make plans to steal it. The gang begin to play both sides of the feud between the families, doing jobs for both of them to make a profit.
				All this comes to a head however, when the matriarch of the Braithwaites, find out that the gang has been playing both sides and kidnap Jack, John's son. Dutch brings John, Arthur, Hosea, and some other gang members to attack Braithwaite manor and take back Jack.
				Once the dust settles, the gang finds out that Jack has already been sent to Angelo Bronte, a mob boss in Saint Denis.</h3>

				<h3> Arthur leads the gang in moving to an abandoned house near Saint Denis and begin searching for Bronte. They eventually meet and Bronte agrees to give back Jack in exchange for a small job. The gang continue to work with Bronte until he finds out that the gang has been planning to rob the city bank, which he controls.
				He sends lawmen to kill Dutch and Arthur during a job and in retaliation, Dutch brings the gang to Bronte's mansion and kills all his men and feeds him to an alligator, a very brutal act that has Arthur and John shocked.  With Bronte dead, the gang is ready to go through with the heist, however more lawmen show up than expected and Hosea is shot and killed. The gang make their escape on a 
				boat. To add to the gang's desperate situation, a storm heavily damages the boat and they all end up stranded on an island.

			<h3> The gang end up on an island north of Cuba, called Guarma. The island is the staging ground for a revolutionary war between the slaves on the islands and the Spanish occupiers who are using the island as a sugar plantation. Dutch decides that the only way off the island is to help the locals win. After several missions alongside the locals, the tipping point of the war occurs at a fortress, where
			the combined force of the locals and the gang sink a Spanish gunship, effectively removing Spanish control from the island. However, Arthur begins to notice a change in Dutch, as if all the stress of the past months, and now the death of his bestfriend, has finally affected him.

			</a>
			<h3> The group stranded on Guarma reunite with the others back on the mainland, but the celebration is brief, as they are immeadiately attacked by
			Pinkertons in the temporary camp they had set up. This forces the gang to relocate once again. While in Saint Denis, Arthur begins coughing uncontrollably and passes out. He wakes up and finds out he has Tuberculosis, which he contracted from the man he beat in chapter 2. THis shatters Arthur's world view and he realizes he must change his way and seek redemption for his sins.</h3>

			<h3> With Arthur finding out that he only has a few weeks left to live, he tries to make peace with his life and does his best to remain honorable. Arthur and Sadie, a woman they saved and took in during chapter 1, break John out of prison, as he was arrested during the failed heist in Saint Denis. 
			Arthur begins to notice that Dutch has been listening to Micah more and more. Micah is a sadistic member of the gang who has caused nothing but trouble since the start. Dutch, Arthur, and Micah ride to Annesberg where they meetup with Cornwall and kill him. While Arthur continues to seek redemption and forgiveness, Dutch slips further into madness. All the hardships that have befallen the gang have caused several 
            members to leave.</h3>

			<h3> Dutch decides that in order to get out of their situation, they must get a final sum of money in order to leave the country. He decides that the best target would be a train carrying army bonds and supplies, as these are worth a lot. Meanwhile, Arthur decides that before he dies, he will make sure that John and his family are able to leave the gang and build a new life.
				However, during the robbery, John is shot and presumed dead, while his wife, Abigail is captured by the Pinkertons. Arthur pleads with Dutch to rescue Abigail, but Micah convinces Dutch to let her die. Arthur decides that he and Sadie will rescue Abigail themselves. After freeing her, they are confronted by Agent Milton, who reveals that Micah has been snitching on the gang and is the reason why the law was always there to foil the gang. 
				While he is caught off guard Abigail shoots Agent Milton, killing him. Arthur sends off Abigail and Sadie, along with Jack and he rides back to camp to confront Dutch and Micah</h3>

			<h3> Years later, John and his family live on a ranch as helpers. Eventually, John buys a home for them in a place called "Beecher's Hope". Eventually, John receives a letter from Sadie,who is now a bounty hunter, telling him to meet her at Valentine. After they reunite they begin to work together as bounty hunters in order to gain some money. They eventually run into Charles, who became a brawler in Saint Denis. John tries to spend as much time with his family as he can as he knows that they are what truly
			matters to him. They also reunite with Uncle, an old member of the gang, who John lets stay at his home. Sadie arrives one day with news, she has found Micah and invites John to come with her and Charles to finish what Arthur started.</h3>

			<h3> Despite Abigail's pleading, John goes with Sadie and Charles to find Micah. They ride to the town of Strawberry, where one of Micah's goons, Cleet, is being tried for murder. After retrieving information about Micah's whereabouts, John and Sadie execute Cleet and make their way to the mountain, where Micah is holed up. As they arrive, Micah's goon's intercept them and manage to injure Charles. Charles is forced to stay behind as John and Sadie make their way to Micah. Sadie is also hurt during the shootout, but manages to survive. 
			As they reach the top of the mountain they see Micah, who is accompanied by one other person, Dutch. They have a standoff with Dutch ultimately realizing how much Micah has manipulated him over the years and shoots him. John finishes off Micah and finds the money the gang left behind in Blackwater all those years ago hidden inside Micah's cabin. Years after his death, Arthur is finally avenged by John, who proudly wears the hat Arthur gave him before he died.</h3>
